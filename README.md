My team and I worked on developing a robotic arm that could be controlled through the use of a Vr Headset (for computer aided vision) and motion control

I was in charge of developing the client/server protocols for video transmission from the robot arm to the headset. As well as the client/server for the arm movement information from the user to the robot arm.
